# Project overview

## Purpose

`web-tui-kit` is a reusable browser UI design system for applications that should present a consistent text-oriented interface inspired by Debian debconf, `dialog`, and `whiptail`.

Its primary use case is to let independent browser applications share one UI language and to give humans and coding assistants a durable reference that can be reused instead of recreating the style from screenshots or chat history.

## Users

- developers building browser-based tools,
- AI coding agents implementing those tools,
- end users operating the resulting interfaces on Linux desktops and Android devices.

## Scope

The repository provides design tokens, CSS component styles, small progressive-enhancement JavaScript, an executable demo, requirements, architecture documentation, and development guidance.

The accepted behavioral contract is canonical in `openspec/specs/`.

## Non-goals

`web-tui-kit` is not a terminal emulator, ncurses binding, application backend, routing framework, or full application framework. Consuming applications remain responsible for their domain logic, data access, authentication, routing, and application-specific behavior.

## Maturity

The project is in early development. The current implementation establishes the visual foundation and common window, form, menu, table, button, and status patterns. No stable release has been published yet.
